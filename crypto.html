			<p>End-to-end encryption is the name for a group of systems that deliver data encrypted the entire time from the sender to the recipient. In its simplest form, this would be the equivalent to using a cipher to encrypt a letter, mailing it to a specific recipient, and them decrypting it with that same cipher only you two share. The basic one on one setup is relatively simple, and can be achieved for digital communication using symmetric, or shared-key, encryption, meaning the code to encode and decode the content is the same. The issue lies in establishing this shared code. An attacker might impersonate whoever you are trying to communicate with, causing you to share a code with a malicious person rather than the real recipient. This brings the need for another type of encryption, asymmetric, or key-pair encryption. This method is the basis of online security and relies on math that allows a user to create two keys: a private key and a public key. The nature of the keys means that a message encoded with one can only be decoded by the other. This means two good things for users. First, by encrypting a message with their own private key, a user can sign that message, once encrypted, it can only be decrypted using the sender's public key, allowing the recipient to verify the authenticity of the message. Second, by encrypting a message with the recipients public key, you can ensure the message is kept secret from attackers as only the recipient can decrypt it using their own private key. Because these public keys are externally verifiable, many systems use this approach to then establish a simpler symmetric encryption channel. (Shillinger, Duan). If you’d like an indepth look into how the math of how key pair, or RSA, encryption works, check out this video: </p>

			<p>That’s the encryption part, so where’s the end-to-end part. Well, all end-to-end in this context means that the data is not in a readable format anywhere between the sender’s and the recipient's computer. This is how we expect anything sent between only two computers to work, it’s how standard web encryption (the padlock icon in your browser) works. However, ‘end-to-end’ is usually more often used to describe it when three or more computers are involved. In these cases, it means that a message is transferred between each computer in its encrypted state, and isn't decrypted until it has reached the final recipient. The key point here is that the in between computers can NEVER read the content of the message. Practically, this means that providers of encrypted chat systems such as Whatsapp and Telegram can’t know what you’re texting, only who you’re texting. This has an important advantage: confidentiality. In some scenarios when communicating sensitive information, a person may want to take care to ensure only their intended recipients can read a message. This importantly excludes hackers from reading them: if a Whatsapp’s system is breached and hackers gain access to records, they would not be able to read any client’s messages. However, a problem arises when this system excludes another external reader: the government. (Shillinger, Duan)</p>
			
			<p>A government, for a number of reasons, is motivated to have access to otherwise private messages sent amongst its constituents. If a message is effectively encrypted, law enforcement investigators are unable to do this: “A term used in the law enforcement field, ‘going dark,’ refers to the process by which encryption or other techniques obscure information  in  ways  that prevent the government from accessing it” (Duan, 2), even in cases where that entity typically would have access, given search and seizure laws. This, understandably, is frustrating to those seeking to enforce laws, whether that be in a play for power or a genuine concern for public safety, “the FBI has expressed a ‘fear of missing out’ on preventable crimes or prosecutable criminals, arguing that it cannot access the necessary evidence” (Duan, 2). Many officials call for either some sort of restriction of the technology or the addition of a backdoor.</p>
			
			<p>A backdoor to encryption is just that, a secondary method to accessing encrypted data. A backdoor can come in many forms: a master password that always works, a special chip that spies on you, or,  most commonly, intentionally implementing a flaw into your encryption system allowing anyone with the right key to break it. The latter method has actually been used by the NSA in their inclusion of a flaw in a system of elliptic curve encryption (Buresh). On its face, the idea of a backdoor seems reasonable: law enforcement can access private messages when they need it for an investigation. In the US, it might sound well within the reasoning of the 4th Amendment given the presence and legality of wiretaps. However, if you ask any computer scientist, they’ll likely agree that the ability to perform encryption is intrinsic to having a computer and that adding a backdoor to encryption services would be foolish. This is because an encryption backdoor is fundamentally different from a wiretap. Where a wiretap can be put in place to monitor activity for a certain period of time and then is removed, a backdoor would allow access to messages retroactively. It would also let law enforcement circumvent requirements for warrants and the like to search personal data, “The USA Freedom Act of 2015 imposes further limits on long-term government collection of ‘call detail records” and certain mass wiretapping. Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 prohibits the government from wiretapping any “wire or oral communication” without consent or prior judicial authorization, and requires the government to make a high showing of the need for wiretapping” (Daun, 6). This requirement for demonstrating need would not exist with a backdoor.
			</p>
			
			<p>It isn’t even worth considering adding backdoors into encryption if there isn’t reasonable evidence to show it helps anything. Law enforcement’s arguments for such a backdoor are seldom backed by any data to support it, using anecdotal cases where it might’ve sped up an investigation, “As it stands, such evidence has not surfaced in the first place” (Daun, 4). In some cases, the FBI has managed to hack phones to retrieve the data they need without there being a backdoor in the first place (Buresh). If anything, a backdoor could do more harm than good. Opening that door not only gives the government another route for mass surveillance, but also provides an avenue for potential criminals to access private data, should the backdoor be somehow insecure. The mere existence of such a backdoor in the first place is a threat to freedom of expression on the internet, “Suppose electronic devices have backdoors where the government can intercept messages. In that case, there is the distinct possibility that people will be afraid to speak their minds to others for fear of governmental retribution” (Buresh). 
			</p>
			
			<p>Despite these flaws with regulating encryption, many governments are seeking to crack down on it. Each of these ‘solutions’ ultimately run into a fundamental problem: “allowing government access to encrypted data, without somehow breaking encryption” (O’Brien). Both the US and the EU (where most social media and chat companies are) are considering implementing regulations on how end to end encryption is managed. The fact that this discussion is happening at all demonstrates a fundamental flaw with certain lawmaking where legislators don’t know anything about what they’re legislating. This leads to situations such as when the Australian prime minister stated that “The laws of mathematics are very commendable, but the only law that applies in Australia is the law of Australia” when confronted with the fact that a computer can do encryption whether a government likes it or not (Revell). Freedom of speech and information is fundamental, and it can and should be preserved through encryption.
