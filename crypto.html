			<p>I realize this probably looks pretty ugly at the moment. I decided I'd like to host this on my own site rather than any builders, but that essentially means building the style elements from scratch. I copied what I have over from the rest of my site (which I haven't put too much effort into as of yet). I'll develop the styling here as I find time between other work.</p>
			
			<p>I haven't incorporated much from my sources yet, I've been a bit busy but will have more time to work on developing the real meat of the paper in the next few weeks, I'll include my annotated bib here too as I think that has some about each source that I eventually want to work into my page. So far I've effectively written a short description of how basic end to end encryption systems work. My main question for just this section would be: since I am trying to approach peers with this, I was wondering if the level of technicality and detail presented here is approachable, i.e, should I dumb it down a bit, keep it about the same, or include more technical details when editing or writing other sections. I have a direction in mind for the rest of the project, so how I should go in terms of technicality would be a help moving forward.</p>
			
			<p>End-to-end encryption is the name for a group of systems that deliver data encrypted the entire time from the sender to the recipient. In its simplest form, this would be the equivalent to using a cipher to encrypt a letter, mailing it to a specific recipient, and them decrypting it with that same cipher only you two share. The basic one on one setup is relatively simple, and can be achieved for digital communication using symmetric, or shared-key, encryption, meaning the code to encode and decode the content is the same. The issue lies in establishing this shared code. An attacker might impersonate whoever you are trying to communicate with, causing you to share a code with a malicious person rather than the real recipient. This brings the need for another type of encryption, asymmetric, or key-pair encryption. This method is the basis of online security and relies on math that allows a user to create two keys: a private key and a public key. The nature of the keys means that a message encoded with one can only be decoded by the other. This means two good things for users. First, by encrypting a message with their own private key, a user can sign that message, once encrypted, it can only be decrypted using the sender's public key, allowing the recipient to verify the authenticity of the message. Second, by encrypting a message with the recipients public key, you can ensure the message is kept secret from attackers as only the recipient can decrypt it using their own private key. Because these public keys are externally verifiable, many systems use this approach to then establish a simpler symmetric encryption channel. </p>
			
			<p>I'd like to incorporate embeded elements for this project, perhaps later I could write some sort of interactive activity for readers, but for now one of the simple things to do is embed tweets like this:</p>
			
			<div class="tweet">
				<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-theme="dark"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear furry artists,<br><br>If I used a pfp that you created in my collage, I am willing to pay you $5k to mint this pfp on Ethereum as a 1/1 and send to my wallet. You will need to be able to verify that you were in fact the creator of the original to be eligible.
