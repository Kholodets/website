			<p>End-to-end encryption is the name for a group of systems that deliver data encrypted the entire time from the sender to the recipient. In its simplest form, this would be the equivalent to using a cipher to encrypt a letter, mailing it to a specific recipient, and them decrypting it with that same cipher only you two share. The basic one on one setup is relatively simple, and can be achieved for digital communication using symmetric, or shared-key, encryption, meaning the code to encode and decode the content is the same. The issue lies in establishing this shared code. An attacker might impersonate whoever you are trying to communicate with, causing you to share a code with a malicious person rather than the real recipient. This brings the need for another type of encryption, asymmetric, or key-pair encryption. This method is the basis of online security and relies on math that allows a user to create two keys: a private key and a public key. The nature of the keys means that a message encoded with one can only be decoded by the other. This means two good things for users. First, by encrypting a message with their own private key, a user can sign that message, once encrypted, it can only be decrypted using the sender's public key, allowing the recipient to verify the authenticity of the message. Second, by encrypting a message with the recipients public key, you can ensure the message is kept secret from attackers as only the recipient can decrypt it using their own private key. Because these public keys are externally verifiable, many systems use this approach to then establish a simpler symmetric encryption channel. If you’d like an indepth look into how the math of how key pair, or RSA, encryption works, check out this video: </p>

			<p>That’s the encryption part, so where’s the end-to-end part. Well, all end-to-end in this context means that the data is not in a readable format anywhere between the sender’s and the recipient's computer. This is how we expect anything sent between only two computers to work, it’s how standard web encryption (the padlock icon in your browser) works. However, ‘end-to-end’ is usually more often used to describe it when three or more computers are involved. In these cases, it means that a message is transferred between each computer in its encrypted state, and isn't decrypted until it has reached the final recipient. The key point here is that the in between computers can NEVER read the content of the message. Practically, this means that providers of encrypted chat systems such as Whatsapp and Telegram can’t know what you’re texting, only who you’re texting. This has an important advantage: confidentiality. In some scenarios when communicating sensitive information, a person may want to take care to ensure only their intended recipients can read a message. This importantly excludes hackers from reading them: if a Whatsapp’s system is breached and hackers gain access to records, they would not be able to read any client’s messages. However, a problem arises when this system excludes another external reader: the government.</p>
			
			<p>I'd like to incorporate embeded elements for this project, perhaps later I could write some sort of interactive activity for readers, but for now one of the simple things to do is embed tweets like this:</p>
