          <div class="header">New York City</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>This is the City where Jack begins in the novel, many times he seeks to escape the dread of the east but he always inevitably returns to the city.</p>
            <p>Jack himself lived in Ozone park. His mother also lived in New York. As did Neal at some points and Jack’s (then) girlfriend Joan.</p>
            <p class="quote">“...making me see with my innocent road eyes the absolute madness and fantastic hooray of New York with its millions and millions hustling forever for a buck among themselves...grabbing, taking, giving, sighing, dying, just so they could be buried in those awful cemetery cities beyond Long Island City” - 211 </p>
            <p class="quote">“[I had] a dream about a strange Arabic figure that was pursuing me across the desert; that I tried to avoid; that finally overtook me just before I reached the Protective City ‘Who is this?’....Something, someone, some spirit was bound to catch us before we reached heaven. Naturally… this is only death: death will overtake us before heaven. The one thing that we yearn for in our living days, that makes us sigh and groan and undergo sweet nauseous of all kinds, is the sweet remembrance of some lost bliss that was probably experienced in the woub and can only be reproduced in death. I told Neal and he instantly recognized it as the mere simple longing for pure death...” - 225</p>

          <div class="header">Denver</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>Early in the novel, Denver seems to be a large part of Jack’s image of ‘the West’. In Book 1, he hitchhikes there to see his friends who have already traveled there, Neal Cassidy and Allen Ginsburg, who he seems to look up to somewhat.</p>
            <p>Book 3 starts with Jack in Denver, prepared to move his family to a home near the city, which may represent a sense of potential stability and settling down for Jack, as he is unsatisfied with New York, but these plans fall through and he begins travelling with Neal again. After going west to San francisco to pick him up, they come back through Denver on their way east and continue via a travel bureau car.</p>
            <p>Jack and Neal also pass through as they changed direction from west to south on their journey to Mexico in Book 4. Neal is forced to make a tough departure from his aging father here.</p>
            <p class="quote">“In a minute just ahead over the rolling wheatfields all golden beneath the destined snows of Estes I’d be seeing old Denver at last. I pictured myself in a Denver bar that night, with all the gang, and in their eyes I would be strange and ragged and like the Prophet that has walked across the land to bring the dark Word, and the only Word I had was Wow.” - 138</p>
            <p class="quote">“Here I made an attempt to settle down those I love…. I believed in a sane and sound living…. I was suddenly left with nothing in my hands but a handful of crazy stars….I stood poised on the great western plain and didn’t know what to do. I said to myself ‘Well I might as well go be mad again’ and I made preparations to go get Neal…” - 280-281</p>

          <div class="header">San Francisco</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>In the novel, San Francisco is somewhat romanticized as an ideal bustling city of the west.</p>
            <p>In Book 1, Jack travels to the city after becoming tired of Denver. He meets up with Henri Cru in Marin City and earns money working as a police guard at some barracks for staging ship workers. Jack is still dissatisfied with this, having many wild nights in the city, and eventually finds himself bored and longing for a girl to love.</p>
            <p>Jack and Neal conclude the journey they make in Book 2 in San Francisco. Neal goes between Louanne and Carolyn.</p>
            <p>In Book 3, Jack comes to San Francisco to pick up Neal before heading back east.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Marin City.... It was, so they say, the only community in America where whites and Negroes lived together voluntarily..." - 162</p>
            <p class="quote">“‘Oh where is the girl I love?” I thought, and looked everywhere, as I had looked everywhere in the little world below. And before me was the great raw bulge of my American continent; somewhere far across gloomy crazy New York was throwing up its cloud of dust and brown steam. There is something brown and holy about the East; and California is while like washlines and empty-souled---at least that’s what I thought then. I’d learn better later.” - 181</p>
            <p class="quote">“We wandered around carrying our bundles of rags in the narrow romantic streets. Everybody looked like a broken-down movie extra, a withered starlet; -disenchanted stunt-men, midget auto racers, poignant California characters with their end-of-the-continent sadness, handsome decadent Casanovish men, puffy-eyed motel blondes, hustlers, pimps, whores, masseurs, bellhops, a lemon lot and how’s a man going to make a living with a gang like that.” - 272<p>

          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>In Book 1, after leaving San Francisco, Jack travels south to Los Angeles. On the bus on the way there, he meets a Mexican girl named Beatrice on the way to Los Angeles. They stay there a few days and tour around before leaving to go to Beatrice’s hometown.</p>
            <p>Similarly to San Francisco, Los Angeles represents the furthermost point of western-ness, a gathering place for all those with no continent left.</p>
            <p class="quote">“It was the end of the continent, no more land. Somebody had tipped the American continent like a pinball machine and all the goofballs had come rolling to LA in the southwest corner. I cried for all of us. There was no end to the American sadness and the American madness. Someday we’ll all start laughing and roll on the ground when we realize how funny it’s been.” - 206</p>

          <div class="header">Selma</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>Selma is the hometown of Jack’s girlfriend Beatrice, who he met on the way to Los Angeles from San Francisco in Book 1. After spending some time in LA, the pair goes to stay with ‘Bea’s family in Selma. Jack seems to find the town pleasantly quaint, but there is not enough excitement, and he yearns to return to New York. He eventually does so, leaving Bea behind.</p>
            <p>He also passes through Selma on his way to San Francisco in Book 2.</p>
            <p class="quote">“The thought of living in a tent and picking grapes in the cool California mornings hit me right. But there were no jobs to be had and much confusion with everybody giving us innumerable tips and places to go that didn’t materialize a job” - 191</p>
            <p class="quote">"I made love to her under the tarantula. What was the tarantula doing?" - 201</p>

            <p>In Book 1, on Jack’s journey back East, after reaching the last station of his bus trip in Pittsburgh, Jack hitches all the way east to Harrisburg. But he is not able to make it on to New York and is forced to hike back to Pittsburgh. During this time, he is able to somewhat reflect on his journey on the cusp of its end. It is one of the lower points in his journey, and he realizes more about this eastern portion of the country.</p>
            <p class="quote">“I thought all the wilderness of America was in the West till the Ghost of the Susquehanna showed me different. No, there is a wilderness in the East, it’s the same Wilderness Ben Franklin plodded in the oxcart days when he was postmaster, when George Washington was a wildbuck Indian fighter, when Daniel Boone told stories by Pennsylvania lamps and promised to find the Gap; when Bradford built his road and men whooped her up in log cabins. There were no great Arizona spaces for the little man, just the bushy wilderness of Eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, the backgrounds, the blacktar roads that curve among the mournful rivers like Susquehana, Monongahela, old Potomac, and Monocacy. This experience shattered me;” - 209-210</p>

          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>This is the town where Jack begins in Book 2, spending Christmas with family. At the beginning of Book 2, he travels back and forth between here and New York transporting furniture.</p>

          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>On Neal and Jack’s way to San Francisco in Book 2, they go along the Gulf Coast and the South of the country. They stop in New Orleans to pick up Helen Hinkle and stay with Bill Burroughs for a few days. Jack often contemplates the Mississippi River throughout the novel, including in New Orleans, talking about everything it brings throughout the country all to the Louisiana Delta, including logs from Montana.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Those bastards have invented plastics by which they could make houses that last FOREVER. Ant tires. Americans are killing themselves by the millions every year with defective rubber tires that get hot on the road and blow up…. Same with clothes. They can make clothes that last forever. They prefer making cheap goods so everybody’ll have to go on working and punching timeclocks and organizing themselves in sullen unions and floundering around while the big grab goes on in Washington and Moscow.” - 250</p>

          <div class="header">Fredericksburg, Texas</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>In the Texas Plains near Fredericksburg, Neal and Jack get their car stuck in the snow and are forced to get out and soak themselves to get it out. Apparently, just then, January 1949 was one of the worst winters in Texas history.</p>

        <div class="destination">
          <div class="header">San Antonio</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>San Antonio was one of the more major cities Jack, Neal, and Frank Shepherds encountered on their way from Denver to Mexico City in Book 4. Here they start noticing some of the cultural shifts as they move South. Neal also went to the hospital for his finger, which he had injured in and got infected in a fight with Louanne.</p>
            <p class="quote">“We were almost out of America and yet definitely in it and in the middle of where it’s maddest. Hotrods blew by.” - 373</p>

        <div class="destination">
          <div class="header">Laredo and Nuevo Laredo</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>Laredo is the city spanning the Mexican border where Jack, Neal, and Frank crossed into Mexico in Book 4 of the novel. This was an important moment for them as they had seldom or never left the country otherwise, and the sudden cultural difference between the two sides of the same city was stark to them.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Just across the street Mexico began. We looked with wonder. To our amazement it looked exactly like Mexico. It was three in the morning and fellows in strawhats and white pants were lounging by the dozen against battered pocky storefronts. ‘Look...at...those...cats!’ Whispered Neal.’” - 375</p>
            <p class="quote">“Behind us lay the whole continent of America and everything Neal and I had previously known about life, and life on the road. We had finally found the magic land at the end of the road and we never dreamed the extent of the magic either.” - 377</p>

        <div class="destination">
          <div class="header">Ciudad Victoria</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>On their way to Mexico City, the trio of Jack, Neal, and Frank pass through and stay in Victoria. Here, they do two main things. First, smoke marijuana with some new friends, where Jack reflects on the language barrier and the observation of other cultures without looking down on them. Then they spend the evening at a whorehouse where they get drunk and lust for young girls (not that that is too much different from what they do regularly). Their time in Victoria feels important as it’s when they first let loose in Mexico and get a real sense of what many of the people there are like.</p>
            <p class="quote">“Everyone became so high that usual formalities were dispensed with and the things of immediate interest were concentrated on, and what it was now, was the strangeness of Americans and Mexicans blasting together on the desert and more than that, the strangeness of seeing one another up close. So the mexican brothers began talking about us in low voices and commenting, while Neal, Frank, and I commented on them…” - 383</p>

          <div class="header">Mexico City</div>
          <div class="dest-body">
            <p>Mexico City is the end of the whole journey for Jack and Neal.They do not stay here forever: Neal was there for the sake of filing quick divorce papers, and Jack also leaves in his own time. Mexico city is the culmination of the experiences they’ve had up to then, seeing the different sorts of people not just between Mexico and America but as how they changed going North to South and East to West.</p>
            <p class="quote">“We stopped on a ledge where a little thatched hut suspended itself over the precipice of the world….a little three year old Indian girl stood with her finger in her mouth watching us with big brown eyes. ‘She’s probably never seen anybody parked here before in her entire life!’ breathed Neal…. ‘Think of it being born and living on this ledge---this ledge representing all you know of life….notice the beads of sweat on her brow...it’s not the kind of sweat we have, it’s oily and it’s ALWAYS THERE because it’s ALWAYS hpt the year round and she knows nothing of non-sweat, she was born with sweat and dies with sweat.’” - 397</p>
