            <h3>1: New York City</h3>
            <p>This is the City where Jack begins in the novel, many times he seeks to escape the dread of the east but he always inevitably returns to the city.</p>
            <p>Jack himself lived in Ozone park. His mother also lived in New York. As did Neal at some points and Jack’s (then) girlfriend Joan.</p>
            <p class="quote">“...making me see with my innocent road eyes the absolute madness and fantastic hooray of New York with its millions and millions hustling forever for a buck among themselves...grabbing, taking, giving, sighing, dying, just so they could be buried in those awful cemetery cities beyond Long Island City” - 211 </p>
